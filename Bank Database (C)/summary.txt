After conducting the test cases listed in the testplan spreadsheet on my bank database program, the functionality of the program seemed to work as I expected. The printRecord, printAllRecord, modifyRecord, deleteRecord, readfile, addRecord, and writefile functions all worked according to the instructions given on the assignment page. There were a few test cases that have failed. When I ran the program in debug mode with the command: './project1 debug', it will show the main menu of the program, but it will also display the debug messages of readfile and addRecord. For that test case, it stated that it should only display the main menu. Another failed test case was when I call the modifyRecord function and enter an account number that is not in the database, it will prompt the user to enter a new address and after the user is done, it will then display an error message stating the account number does not exist. The test case wanted it to be that when modifyRecord is called and an account number that does not exist is entered, it will display the error message without asking the user to get the the new address. The other failed test cases were just debug messages being displayed when they were not supposed to. For example, when addRecord is called in debugmode, it will display the getaddress debug message, when the test case expects only the addRecord debug message to display. This also goes for when modifyRecord is called. When the program is quitting, it displays the writefile debug message, but the test case only stated that it shows a confirmation message and quits. Therefore, that test case also failed.
